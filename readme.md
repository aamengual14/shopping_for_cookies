# Cookie Shopping Cart

## Description
We're going to build a shopping cart that allows us to buy different types of cookies and add them to our cart. A user should be able to click on the "Add to Cart" button for each cookie to add the cookie to their cart. When the page is refreshed, the cookies should remain in the cart. You should be able to see the number of items in the cart, as well as a list of the item names. The shopping cart should be specific to each user, and not be stored globally for everyone!

## Bonus
Allow users to remove items from the shopping cart with a button next to each item in the list. You'll probably need to use the [method override](https://github.com/expressjs/method-override) module (which is already installed) to get a "delete" method working.
